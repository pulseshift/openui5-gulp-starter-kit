# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, @global-owner1 and @global-owner2
# will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
